## Project Description

1. **File Descriptions**:
   - `DualDis_model.py`: Contains the core model architecture implementation.
   - `vis_retrieval_capability.py`: Experimental code for retrieval capability evaluation.
   - `FS.py`: Experiments analyzing the impact of symmetric features (from symmetry-based methods) and asymmetric features on discriminative feature learning.
2. **QA**
   - For any questions regarding this work, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'd be honored to discuss them with you.

2. **Note**:
   - This project demonstrates the effectiveness of component decoupling, channel sparsification, and symmetric pattern analysis for vehicle re-identification tasks.
